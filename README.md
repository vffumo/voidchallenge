# EXTRA INFO
"I've implemented an Auto Login feature because I noticed that the token expires after a few hours. Without this feature, you would need to constantly log in using API consumption tools to obtain a new token. Alternatively, generating a new token with each session would be inefficient and would create unnecessary overhead, which is considered a bad practice."
